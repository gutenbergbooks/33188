<h2>LESSONS ON MANNERS.</h2>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is true that good manners, like good morals, are
best taught by the teacher's example. It is also true
that definite lessons, in which the subject can be
considered in its appropriate divisions, are of no
little value if we would have our children attain to
"that finest of the fine arts, a beautiful behavior."</p>

<p>Such lessons should be as familiar and conversational
as possible. They ought to be talks rather
than lectures; and the children should be encouraged
to do a large part of the talking. Children that
come from homes where good manners are taught
and practised, will be glad to repeat the precepts of
politeness learned in the home circle; and those less
favored will not want to be behind in this hitherto
unstudied branch. We must remember that many
children hear no mention of politeness outside the
school-room, and are uncouth and rude, not so much
because they choose to be, as because they do not
know how to be otherwise.</p>

<p>I have used in my own schools of different grades
a series of simple lessons, varying both matter and
method according to the age and capacity of scholars.
The good results have been marked, not only in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
school-room, but at home and in public places; and
years afterwards scholars have expressed their grateful
appreciation of this instruction and its value to
them in every-day life. I have thought that the publication
of these outline lessons might be a help to
other teachers also, in the way of offering suggestions
and saving time in preparing lessons for their
own classes.</p>

<p>For some classes the lessons as arranged in this
little book may be too long, for others too short.
They are outlines merely, to be filled in and supplemented
by each teacher, adding to, taking from, and
varying them at her discretion.</p>

<p>It may seem unnecessary to touch upon such simple
things as some that are spoken of. The teacher,
perhaps, cannot remember when these axioms were
not familiar to her; but let her put questions to the
children concerning them, and she will find in many
schools that to half the pupils she is talking in an
unknown tongue. Matters are mentioned which do
not concern them now so much as they will a few
years later; as, for instance, conduct at places of
amusement and in company; but in these things, as
in their school studies, boys and girls are learning
now for the future.</p>

<p>My plan would be to have a familiar talk with the
children one day, drawing from them, as far as it
can be done, the rules of behavior which the teacher
wishes to impress upon them. When she can illustrate
a point by a story, the impression will be deepened.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
It is well also to speak of acts which have
come under the teacher's eye in the school-room, on
the play-ground, or on the way to school, and let the
children decide whether these were polite or impolite,
and why. This will make the whole matter more real
to them, and, if they are encouraged to furnish illustrations,
they will open their eyes and find them in
their own little worlds. We want our children in
school, from the youngest to the oldest, to notice a
breach of politeness as quickly as an error in recitation.
A little girl of five from a wretched family,
who had proved an apt scholar in the branch under
consideration, one day performed some trifling service
for an awkward little new scholar. I shall never
forget her look and tone of amazement as she turned
to her teacher with, "Why! he didn't say 'Thank
you.'"</p>

<p>At the time of the next exercise, I would have the
children reproduce from an outline placed upon the
blackboard the precepts deduced from the previous
talk, not insisting upon any form of words, but encouraging
them to use their own. This will be also
a good oral exercise in language. If the scholars
are old enough, this oral review can be put upon
paper, either at this time or for a composition exercise
another day. Nothing except practising the
precepts will so fix these in their minds.</p>

<p>If the teacher thinks best, a copy of this manual
may be placed in the hands of each scholar, and the
lesson prepared like other lessons, from the printed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
page. This course would diminish the amount of
blackboard writing.</p>

<p>Let the teacher, when it seems wise, commend
acts of politeness in her scholars. If they know she
sees and appreciates their efforts, they will redouble
them.</p>

<p>It should be her constant aim to lead her scholars
so to think on these things that are lovely and of
good report in the province of manners, as well as
in the higher one of morals, to which it is so closely
allied, that thinking may take the shape of doing,
and doing may crystallize into habit.</p>

<h2>LESSON I.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>MANNERS IN GENERAL.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> has been said, "Manners are something with
every one, and everything with some."</p>

<p>Strangers will judge us entirely by our manners,
since they cannot know, as our friends do, what is
beneath this outward behavior.</p>

<p>The Golden Rule is the foundation of true politeness,
which must spring from kindness of heart. If
we earnestly try to do to others what we would have
them do to us, though we may through ignorance
disregard some points of society etiquette, yet we
can hardly be impolite.</p>

<p>Good manners cannot be put on at pleasure, like
an outside coat, but must belong to us. We have
all seen veneering on furniture. At first the cheap
pine article may look as well as if it were made of
the costly wood with which it is covered; but in the
wear and tear of every-day use the veneering will
come off in places, showing the common wood beneath.
So it will be with our manners. If they are
not solid and real throughout, the thin covering of
politeness will break off here and there, especially
when exposed to hard usage, and the real stuff we
are made of will be revealed.</p>

<p>If we carefully observe persons of fine manners,
we shall learn much that can be learned in no other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
way. We must not think we are too well informed
to be taught on this or any subject, but keep our eyes
and ears open, and be always ready to learn a "more
excellent way." The greatest advantage to young
people of being in good society is the opportunity to
learn by observation.</p>

<p>We began this lesson with a quotation, and we
will close by another worth remembering: "Politeness
is like an air-cushion; there may be nothing
solid in it, but it eases the jolts of this world wonderfully."</p>

<h2>LESSON II.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>MANNERS AT SCHOOL.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">We</span> must not forget to say "Good morning" to
the teacher when we first see her before school; or, if
we stop after school to speak to her, "Good afternoon"
when we leave. If a boy comes back into
the room after dismissal, he must remember to take
off his hat.</p>

<p>It is rude to laugh at mistakes or awkwardness:
nothing is more ill-bred as well as unkind. If an
accident occurs, we should not laugh, unless it is so
amusing that all can join without hurting the feelings
of the one concerned.</p>

<p>If an accident happens to the dress or property of
teacher or classmate, we should offer our assistance
quietly, if we can be of use, or else not appear to see
it, and by no means call attention to it.</p>

<p>We ought to try to make a new scholar feel at
home,&mdash;help him to become acquainted with the
others, tell him the rules and customs of the school,
and assist him at first in his lessons if he needs it.
We ought not to stare at him when he enters or rises
to recite, or smile if he makes a mistake. It is kind
to draw him into games at recess until he forgets he
is a stranger. We should be especially careful to do
all this if the new scholar is poorly or peculiarly
dressed, or is crippled, or unfortunate in any way.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>When visitors are present, we must be sure to behave
as well as at other times. If reading or singing
is going on, we should pass them a book, handing it
properly, and should treat them as politely as if they
were at our houses. When the teacher is engaged
with company, we should not disturb her with unnecessary
questions, but busy ourselves until she is
at liberty.</p>

<p>To raise hands when it can be avoided is an impolite
interruption of school work, and is as rude as
talking too much in company. To raise the hand
when a teacher or scholar is speaking is the same
thing as to interrupt them with a remark or question.</p>

<p>We must respect the rights of property. It is
wrong to take a garment, book, or other article before
or after school without asking permission. If
anything is borrowed, it should be returned promptly
with thanks.</p>

<p>If we are distributing materials to the class, we
should hand articles quietly and politely to each in
turn, and in collecting never snatch a book or paper.</p>

<p>When a number of scholars are waiting for a drink
at recess, we sometimes see them crowd and push
one another, each trying to serve himself first. It
makes us think of cattle at a watering-trough. The
cattle know no better, but boys and girls do. The
polite way is for each to stand back and wait his
turn. This is not only the pleasantest but the quickest
way for all to be satisfied. If boys and girls are
waiting together, every gentlemanly boy will wait for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
the girls to drink first, and the girls should accept his
politeness in a polite manner.</p>

<p>The same remark applies to conduct in the dressing-room
before school. Scholars should quietly
wait for others to hang up clothing and use the
looking-glass, instead of pushing forward to secure
the first chance.</p>

<p>These early habits of courtesy or rudeness will
cling to us through life. When we see people rushing
for the best seats in cars or steamboats, and
crowding others aside at counters and railroad restaurants,
we may be reasonably sure they are those
who, when boys and girls at school, pushed others
away from the looking-glass and the drinking place.</p>

<p>In speaking of occurrences, we must not say, "I
and James went." We ought to speak of ourselves
last in all cases, except where mischief has been
done, when we should relate our own share first.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<h2>LESSON III.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>MANNERS ON THE STREET.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Manners</span> on the street are especially important,
because many see us there who never see us elsewhere,
and they will judge us and our home and
school training by our good or bad behavior there.</p>

<p>Noisy and boisterous conduct on the street is
always unbecoming. No well-bred boy or girl will
ever try to attract attention there. To make one's
self conspicuous in public is a sure sign of ignorance
and ill-breeding.</p>

<p>If we wish to speak to a person on the other side
of the street, though it be only a schoolmate, the proper
way is not to call to him, but to cross over quietly
and speak. If we wish to look behind us, we should
not twist the head around, but turn the whole body.</p>

<p>It is extremely rude to walk three or four together,
unless in an unfrequented street, or to stop on corners
to talk.</p>

<p>In meeting persons, we must turn to the right, and
never take more than our share of the sidewalk, and
give an old person or a lady more than half. In
passing people, we should be careful not to crowd or
jostle them; it is better to step off the sidewalk to
pass an older person than to do this. If we are
walking with any one, and wish to take leave or cross<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
the street, we should step behind and not in front of
our companion. A boy should be as careful as a
gentleman to give a lady the inside of the walk.</p>

<p>When we meet an acquaintance we must not say,
"Halloa!" but give or return the proper salutation.
Our tone and manner should be cordial to all and
respectful to older people. For a boy or girl to
bestow upon a teacher or any older person a patronizing
nod instead of a courteous bow, or a curt
"Good morning" or "Good evening" with the rising
inflection on the last syllable, is an impertinence.
Even little boys should learn to lift their hats to
ladies, and also to gentlemen entitled by age or position
to this mark of respect.</p>

<p>We must keep step with the person with whom we
are walking, if we would not make an awkward
appearance. It is proper for a younger person to
accommodate his pace to that of an older, and a
gentleman must keep step with a lady.</p>

<p>If we see any one fall in the street, we should
never be so rude as to laugh, but should hasten to
help if help is needed.</p>

<p>If we speak to a stranger by mistake, we should
ask pardon; and if one speaks to us, we should gracefully
accept his apology, as if the mistake were most
natural, not adding to his embarrassment by our manner
of cold surprise.</p>

<p>If we have occasion to ask directions of a stranger,
we should say, "Will you please tell me if this is the
road to Lynn?" rather than "Say! is this the road<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
to Lynn?" We should never fail to give cordial
thanks for information.</p>

<p>In holding an umbrella over any one, we must
carry it high enough, give more of it than we take,
and in meeting other umbrellas give them their share
of room.</p>

<p>It is ill-mannered to eat anything in the street.
No rubbish, such as paper, nutshells, or orange-peel,
should be thrown on the sidewalk: there is a proper
place for such things; and we ought to have too
much regard for the neat appearance of our streets
to litter them.</p>

<p>In this connection, let us remember that to mark
on walls or fences anywhere not only violates the
right of property, but is exceedingly ill-bred. If we
see names scrawled in public places, we may be sure
the persons thus making themselves conspicuous are
not ladies or gentlemen.</p>

<p>We should never stare at windows of private
houses, and never point at any person. Another
rude thing often done is to ask a ride of a stranger,
or, worse still, to steal one by jumping on his carriage
without asking.</p>

<p>If we see those who are lame or deformed, we
should not call attention to them, or look at them
ourselves in a way to remind them of their infirmities.</p>

<p>If strangers inquire the way of us, we should
answer their questions politely. We should give
directions with clearness, and cheerfully go out of
our way to point out a street or building. Sometimes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
we see on the street persons from the country,
who seem bewildered by the noise and bustle, and uncertain
which way to go. In such cases, especially
if they are old or infirm, we should ask in a kind
way if we can be of service; and we should be glad
to help them out of their difficulty, even if it costs
us time and trouble. The following incident illustrates
this street politeness:&mdash;</p>

<p>"As I was walking along a street of a large city,"
says the writer, "I saw an old man, who seemed to
be blind, walking along without any one to lead him.
He went very slowly, feeling with his cane, and was
walking straight to the curbstone. Just then a boy
who was playing near the corner left his playmates,
ran up to the old man, put his hand through his arm
and said, 'Let me lead you across the street.' He
not only helped him over one crossing, but led him
over another, to the lower side of the street. Now
this boy thought he had only done a kindness to a
poor old man, but in reality he had taught a lesson
of true politeness to his playmates and to every
person who saw the act."</p>

<h2>LESSON IV.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>MANNERS AT HOME.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Our</span> manners at home are of more importance
than our manners anywhere else, for several reasons:
we spend more time at home than elsewhere; our
own family have stronger claims upon us than strangers;
they love us best and do most for us, and
they are entitled not only to our love but to every
courtesy and attention from us. It is a sad thing to
see a boy or girl polite and kind away from home
and to strangers only, while at home he is rude, selfish,
and heedless of every law of good behavior. If
we are always polite in our own homes, we shall be
sure to be polite in other people's homes. If we do
not forget to say "Good morning" and "Good evening"
to each member of our family, we shall not
forget to say them to others.</p>

<p>If a child has fruit or candy, he ought not to sit
down by himself to eat it, without offering some to
his companions.</p>

<p>In olden times it was quite common for a young
man in writing to his father to address him as
"Honored Sir." While these formal modes of
speech may be out of place in our time, we should
so keep the commandment to honor our parents
that its spirit shall be seen in our every-day conduct.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>Children should in all things make parents first
and themselves last. A boy ought to show his
mother every attention that he would to any lady.
He should remove his hat when coming to speak to
her, let her pass through a door before him, pick up
any article she may drop, give her the inside of the
walk, help her into a carriage, show her into the pew
at church, and wait upon her everywhere. He has
similar duties to his sisters; but girls cannot expect
politeness from, unless they give it to, their brothers.</p>

<p>We should say "Please" when asking a favor
from our own family. Children should say "Please"
and "Thank you" to servants, and should never
laugh at their mistakes or hurt their feelings.</p>

<p>Here is an illustration of two ways of treating a
mistake. A servant-girl who had been but a little
while in this country had never seen any radishes.
When the dinner was sent home from market one
day, a bunch of radishes came with the other vegetables.
She supposed they were to be cooked like
the rest, so she carefully cut off the tops and boiled
them, then dished them up on a small white platter,
and placed them on the table with a satisfied look.
A boy in the family burst into a loud laugh and
exclaimed, "I guess you never saw any radishes
before, Mary; you've spoilt them." It was necessary
then to explain the mistake, which had better
been done quietly after dinner; and the poor girl
retired in confusion to shed tears of mortification
over her ignorance. After dinner this boy's little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
sister said to a visitor, "The radishes did look so
funny and small on the dish that I thought I should
laugh, but I knew Mary would feel bad if I did, so I
looked at my plate and tried to think of something
else."</p>

<p>It is easy to decide which of these children illustrated
politeness to servants.</p>

<p>If our parents are away when visitors come, or too
busy to see them at once, it is our place to show them
in politely, take a gentleman's hat, or a lady's wrappings
if she wishes to remove them, offer a comfortable
chair, show them anything that we think will interest
them, and entertain them as well as we can
until older people are at liberty. When they are
busy with company we should not trouble them with
any request that can wait.</p>

<p>If friends of our parents are visiting them, we
should do all we can to make the visit pleasant, and
should help our mothers even more than usual, that
they may have more time for the visitors. If we can
take care of younger brothers or sisters, it will often
be a great relief to them and the company besides.</p>

<p>A lady once went to visit a friend whom she had
not seen for years. There was much to talk about,
and both felt that the afternoon would be all too
short. Think how surprised and pleased the visitor
was when her friend's little daughter, instead of staying
in the room and teasing her mother with all manner
of questions, as children often do in such cases,
took her baby brother upstairs and amused him until<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
tea-time, so that her mother might have a quiet afternoon
with her friend. You may be sure the lady will
never forget that little girl's thoughtful politeness.</p>

<p>We should not enter visitors' rooms without knocking,
or sit down without being invited; neither should
we take up anything belonging to them, or ask questions
about it. We should try not to be tiresome or
disagreeable.</p>

<p>When young people come to visit us we should remember
that their entertainment is our affair. We
should treat them precisely as we would want to be
treated at their houses. It is rude to criticise their
dress or anything belonging to them, or to ask inquisitive
questions about their homes. We should
talk about the things they are interested in, play the
games they like, show them our toys and books, and
have regard to their preferences in every occupation
and amusement.</p>

<p>Home ought to be the happiest place in the world,
and the daily practice of genuine politeness toward
each other will do much to make it so. Every little
seed of courtesy, kindness, and consideration for
others sown in the home circle will spring up and
bear many more after its own kind, which shall be
scattered, like the seeds in nature, by winds and
waters, and shall be a blessing to the world wherever
they may fall.</p>

<h2>LESSON V.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>MANNERS TOWARD THE AGED.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">No</span> person, however high his position, is so entitled
to respect and attention as one with white hair and
bent figure. No young person of right feeling and
good-breeding will ever fail in politeness toward the
old. The Bible commands us to reverence the aged,
and in one place says, "Thou shalt rise up before the
hoary head, and honor the face of the old man."
Even among the lowest races of men respect for old
people is almost universal.</p>

<p>There is a story of an Indian which illustrates this.
The writer tells us that many years ago, on the banks
of the Kennebec River, he saw an Indian coming
across in his canoe. He had his wife with him and
a very old woman covered with a blanket. When he
reached the shore he kindled a fire, took out the old
woman in his arms and laid her down tenderly by it.
He then cooked some food and gave it to her, while
he and his wife waited until she had finished eating.
Seeing the gentleman observing him, he pointed to
the aged woman and said, "It is my mother."</p>

<p>In China disrespect to the aged is unknown, and
disobedience to parents has been punished with
death.</p>

<p>We cannot expect to be honored when we are old,
unless we honor the old when we are young.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>Almost every one has read the story of "The
Wooden Bowl," which well illustrates what has just
been said.</p>

<p>An old man who had a home with his son had become
so infirm that he could no longer work. His
son treated him unkindly, and grudgingly gave him
his scanty portion of coarse food, making the poor
old man feel that he was considered a burden by his
own child. Matters grew worse until at last he was
not allowed to come to the table. His son made for
him a rude wooden bowl, from which he ate his food
in the kitchen.</p>

<p>One day this son saw his own little boy at work
with his jackknife on a piece of wood. "What are
you doing, my child?" he asked. "I am making a
wooden bowl like grandpa's, for you to eat out of
when you are old, father," said the child.</p>

<p>This answer made such an impression upon the
son, showing him what treatment he had a right to
expect from his own children after the example he
had given them, that from that time he treated his
old father with the respect and kindness he himself
wished to receive in his old age.</p>

<p>We should never laugh at mistakes in speech.
The old-fashioned expressions that seem so queer to
us may have been right when those who use them
were young. Some of our ways of speaking will
probably seem as strange to young people when we
are old as theirs do now to us, so we are laughing at
ourselves beforehand. Then we should remember<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
that years ago school privileges were not so great as
they are now. Children then went to school but
little in comparison with us, and their speech was
not watched and corrected by teachers as ours is.
We ought never to criticise mistakes in the aged as
we would in our little brothers and sisters: it is disrespectful;
and besides they are too old to change
habits.</p>

<p>We should listen with attention and with no sign
of impatience to all they say, answer their questions
kindly, and not contradict, even if through forgetfulness
the same question is often asked and mistakes
are made. If they are childish and sometimes fault-finding,
we should treat them with the gentleness we
would show to a little child, together with the respect
that belongs to gray hairs.</p>

<p>If they are hard of hearing, we should repeat patiently
and gently and never shout an answer.</p>

<p>When we talk with them we should talk of what
they care for, even if it is what we are not interested
in. If we try, we can generally become interested
for their sakes. We should be willing to read to
them articles and books that may seem prosy to us;
we ought to think how long the days must seem to
those who are too feeble to go out as we do, and we
should be glad to do what we can to entertain them.</p>

<p>We should cheerfully wait upon old people, and
let them feel that young hands and feet are glad to
take the place of theirs. There are countless little
services which we can perform for them: we can<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
bring grandfather his hat and cane, find a place in
the paper for him with our bright eyes, thread grandmother's
needle, pick up dropped stitches in her
knitting, hunt for her glasses when she loses them,
and run on errands for them both.</p>

<p>They ought to have the most comfortable chairs,
in winter the warmest seats by the fire, and in the
evening the place where their failing eyes shall have
the best light.</p>

<p>If we are sitting in the only rocking-chair in the
room, or in the easiest one, and an old person enters,
we should immediately <i>rise</i> and offer it to him, not
simply ask if he would not like it.</p>

<p>At the table we should see that old people are
helped first and their wants carefully attended to.</p>

<p>In cars or public places, a boy or girl should never
allow an old man or woman to stand, but should
hasten to give up a seat and insist on its being taken,
especially if the person is poorly dressed.</p>

<p>The following story of what happened long ago in
the famous old city of Athens well illustrates this
point:&mdash;</p>

<p>A play was to be performed at the principal theatre
of Athens, and the seats were soon taken. When the
theatre was full, an old man came in and looked
around for a seat. He was quite infirm and could
not stand long. He looked first one way and then
another. At length he saw a party of young Athenians
beckoning to him. He tried to get to them,
which he had to do by climbing over seats and pushing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
through the crowd; and, when at last he reached
them, they sat down, and, instead of giving him the
seat he had expected, took up all the room, leaving
the old man standing.</p>

<p>In this theatre were some seats fitted up for strangers.
These were filled by young Spartans, who, when
they saw the behavior of the Athenians, were much
displeased, and beckoned to the old man to come to
them. When he was near them they all rose and received
him with the greatest respect. The whole assembly,
seeing this, could not help bursting into a
shout of applause.</p>

<p>The old man then said, "The Athenians know what
is right, but the Spartans practise it."</p>

<p>Above all things, we should never let the old feel
that they are in the way, or that it is a relief when
they leave the room. They are usually sensitive to
anything like a slight, and their feelings are quickly
hurt by real or seeming neglect.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<h2>LESSON VI.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>MANNERS AT THE TABLE.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is not polite to linger after being called to the
table. When the bell is rung, or any other summons
given, it is to be supposed that the meal is ready,
and the call should be promptly obeyed. Food does
not improve by waiting, and unnecessary delay is
rudeness to the persons at whose table we sit,
whether our own parents or strangers. When we
know the hours for meals we should plan to be ready
for them.</p>

<p>Until the lady of the house takes her seat, other
persons should not take theirs. In taking our seats
we should be careful not to jar the table.</p>

<p>Each one should quietly wait his turn to be helped.
Children sometimes pass their plates as soon as they
are seated, or begin to handle knife, fork, and spoon
as if they were in hungry haste. They should wait
for visitors and older persons to be helped first, and
brothers should wait for their sisters. A story is
told of a little girl, five years old, who at a large
dinner party was overlooked until the company had
finished the first course. She waited before her
empty plate in perfect quietness until some one
noticed her,&mdash;bravely trying to keep back the tears,&mdash;because
she thought it was the polite and proper
thing to do. This was carrying polite waiting further<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
than was necessary, but was much better than the
rude haste too common among children.</p>

<p>It is polite to wait until all or nearly all are helped
before beginning to eat; and children should never
begin before older people.</p>

<p>It is not polite to ask for things at other tables
than our own or those of intimate friends who expect
it of us. The persons at whose table we sit are
expected to supply our wants without our making
them known. In asking we must not forget to say,
"Please pass the bread," or whatever we wish for,
and to say, "If you please," "Yes, thank you," or
"No, thank you," when we accept or decline what
is offered. We should ask for any article by name,
and never point at the dish. Ill-mannered children
sometimes ask for pie or pudding or oranges before
they are brought on, instead of waiting for the
courses in their proper order, and even have been
known to make their entire dinner on the dessert.
One is apt to think such children are not accustomed
to dainties in their own homes, or they would not be
so greedy for them.</p>

<p>We should never say, "I don't like that," if something
is offered we do not wish to eat, but simply
decline it beforehand or leave it upon our plates
without remark; and under no circumstances should
we criticise what is on the table.</p>

<p>There is a proper, graceful way to handle napkin,
knife, fork, and spoon, and we should study to learn
this way and to avoid the clumsy awkwardness in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
these little things that marks the person unused to
good society.</p>

<p>To eat fast is one of the bad habits of American
people which we ought to avoid. If acquired in
childhood, it will be hard to overcome, and will
cause us much mortification when, later in life, we
find ourselves with empty plates long before well-bred
people in the company have finished theirs.
Since we do not leave the table before others, there
is nothing gained, even in time, while much is lost
in health and in good manners.</p>

<p>We should be attentive to the wants of others,
particularly at our own table, and quietly supply
them when it is proper to do so, especially in the
case of old people and little children. In passing
a knife, fork, or spoon to others, we must offer them
the handle, not the blade or point, and pass a pitcher
with the handle toward them.</p>

<p>If an accident occurs, such as breaking a dish,
overturning a glass of water, or dropping food upon
the cloth, we should take no notice of it by look or
word unless we can repair the mischief, which we
should do in a way not to attract attention to the
unlucky person.</p>

<p>We should never speak of what is unpleasant at
the table. If we have bad news to tell, this is not
the place to tell it. Sickness, accident, death, and
whatever is painful to hear, should not be discussed
any more than what is disagreeable. Neither is the
table the place to talk of work or business details,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
but subjects should be chosen that all are interested
in. No one should be allowed to scold or find fault
at meal time. Cheerful conversation is good for
digestion as well as enjoyment. Each one should
be in his best mood at the table, and the hours which
families spend together there ought to be among the
happiest of the day.</p>

<p>Solomon understood this matter when he said,
"Better is a dinner of herbs where love is, than a
stalled ox and hatred therewith."</p>

<p>No well-bred person would for a moment think of
using a toothpick at the table, still less a fork or a
pin in place of a toothpick.</p>

<p>No one, either a grown person or a child, should
leave his seat until the lady of the house rises, unless
there is good reason for doing so, when he should
politely ask her to excuse him. In rising, the chair
should not be pushed back from the table, but lifted
quietly with the hands, and left in its proper position.
Every movement at the table should be made with
as little noise as possible. All moving of feet, leaning
upon the table, jostling of dishes, or clatter of
knives and forks, shows ignorance of table manners.</p>

<p>If we observe the manners and customs of others
in society to which we have not been accustomed,
we shall be often saved from blunders. If those in
company with us make mistakes, we should be governed
by the same rule as in case of accidents,&mdash;not
take notice unless we can undo or cover the mistake.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
An incident is related of a certain king which illustrates
this true politeness.</p>

<p>At the royal table on one occasion were two ladies
from an obscure provincial town who were unused to
the customs of city and court. When tea was
brought in they poured some from the cup into the
saucer to cool it. The king saw a smile go around
the table at their expense, and, with politeness worthy
of a king, he hastened to pour his own tea into
the saucer, upon which every person at the table felt
obliged to follow the royal example, and the two
strangers were spared the mortification of discovering
that they had done anything unusual.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<h2>LESSON VII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>MANNERS IN SOCIETY.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> we make a call upon a friend, we should
speak to each person in the room when we enter and
when we leave, but at a party or other formal gathering
it is not necessary to take leave of any except
the host and hostess, to whom we must also speak as
soon as we arrive. A visit is a more important matter
than a call, and at its close, we should take pains
to bid good by to each one of the household, expressing
to those who have entertained us, when we
can do so with truth, our enjoyment of the visit, and
our wish to have them visit us.</p>

<p>It is polite to write as soon as possible to those
whom we have been visiting: they wish to know
of our safe arrival at home; and a letter also gives
us opportunity to say any pleasant thing about the
visit that we may have forgotten or omitted.</p>

<p>Upon entering any house a gentleman or gentlemanly
boy will remove his hat, and never allow it
upon his head inside the door.</p>

<p>When the streets are muddy or snowy, we should
carefully wipe our feet or remove our overshoes at
the door; and in stormy weather we must take care
that dripping waterproofs and umbrellas are put
where they will not injure carpets or paper.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>When the company are putting on their wrappings
to go home, it is polite to offer assistance, particularly
to those older than ourselves.</p>

<p>A gentleman should allow a lady to pass through
a door before him, holding it open for her. We
ought not to pass in front of others if we can go
behind them; but if it is necessary to do so, we should
ask them to excuse us. A gentleman should go
upstairs before a lady, and behind her coming down,
taking care not to step on her dress.</p>

<p>If a handkerchief or other article is dropped, we
should hasten to pick it up and restore it to the
owner. In handing a pair of scissors, a knife, or
any pointed article, we ought to turn the point toward
ourselves.</p>

<p>It is rude to stare at people in company, especially
if they are unfortunate in any way or peculiar in
appearance; neither is it polite to allude to a personal
defect or ask a question about its cause, even
in the kindest manner. The same rule applies here
as in case of family misfortune or bereavement, that
if persons suffering the affliction wish it mentioned,
they will speak of it first themselves. To do as
we would be done by is the rule of real politeness in
all these cases.</p>

<p>If an accident happens to persons or their dress,
or if their dress is out of order, if we can give assistance
we should do so in a quiet way without attracting
attention; if we cannot be of use, we should take
no notice of the misfortune. The same principle of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
good-breeding will keep us from laughing at mistakes
or accidents.</p>

<p>To exchange glances with another, to whisper, or
to laugh unless others know what we are laughing
at, is even ruder than to stare, and no one who is
polite will do these things. In company is not the
place to tell secrets or carry on personal or private
conversation.</p>

<p>We should see that our dress is in order before
we enter the room, and then neither think nor speak
of it. To look in the glass, smooth one's gloves and
laces, or play with rings or chain, seems like calling
attention to our dress, and is in bad taste. It would
seem unnecessary here or anywhere to say that attention
to finger-nails, which is a matter of the toilet
for one's chamber, is inexcusable, if we did not
sometimes see persons in the presence of others take
out pocket-knives for this purpose.</p>

<p>It is a common saying that people unused to
society do not know what to do with their hands and
feet. The best direction that can be given is to do
nothing. Let them take easy positions of themselves,
and think no more about them. To sit still
gracefully is an accomplishment worth acquiring,
and it should be studied by boys and girls as well as
grown people. The necessity for it comes so often
in life that we should learn to do it well. We should
not sit on the edge or corner of a chair, or tilt it
backward or forward.</p>

<p>Drumming with the fingers on tables or chairs,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
rocking rapidly back and forth, or looking out of the
window, as if we were more interested in things outside
than in those in the room, should never be done.
It is well said that "if in company we are absent in
mind, we had better be absent in body." "Forget
yourself" is one of the best and broadest precepts of
good behavior; but we should never forget others.</p>

<p>It is often our duty in society to introduce persons
to each other, and we should study to do this gracefully.
It is said of Alice Cary that she had such a
happy way of giving introductions as to make each
person feel specially honored. We should introduce
a gentleman to a lady, saying, "Mr. Smith, Miss
Jones," if we use this simplest form of introduction,
and not "Miss Jones, Mr. Smith," as is often done.
We should introduce a younger person to an older,
unless it be one of our own family, when, "My aunt,
Mrs. Brown, Miss Jones," is proper. We should introduce
strangers to each other at the table and elsewhere
before they have time to feel awkward at not
being able to speak. Great pains should be taken
to pronounce distinctly the names of those introduced.
Too often each person hears only his own.</p>

<p>We should speak of people as Mr., Mrs., or Miss,
except with intimate friends, giving particular titles
when proper, and never allude to any one as "Old
Smith," or "Old Miss Jones."</p>

<p>To make ill-natured remarks about the absent
shows a want of good-breeding as well as good
feeling.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>No one should make himself conspicuous in company
by loud laughing and talking. To make remarks
intended to be overheard, especially remarks
meant to be funny, is clownish,&mdash;and to be a society
clown is a very low ambition.</p>

<p>We must not interrupt one who is speaking, and
must pay attention to remarks addressed to the company.
If a person is speaking to us we ought to
listen attentively, even if we are not interested, and
not hurt his feelings by letting our eyes wander from
him or showing other signs of impatience. A good
listener is as welcome in society as a good talker,
and often more so, because every one who talks
likes to be listened to with appreciative attention.</p>

<p>Those who have read "The Wide, Wide World"
will remember an instance of little Ellen Montgomery's
good-breeding in this respect, when she was
visiting at Ventnor.</p>

<p>"Ellen is a fascinating child," said Mrs. Gillespie,
"I cannot comprehend where she gets the manners
she has. I never saw a more perfectly polite little
girl."</p>

<p>"I have noticed the same thing often," said Miss
Sophia. "Did you observe her last night when John
Humphreys came in? You were talking to her at
the moment. Before the door was opened, I saw
her color come and her eyes sparkle, but she did not
look towards him for an instant till you had finished
what you were saying to her, and she had given, as
she always does, her modest, quiet answer, and then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
her eye went straight as an arrow to where he was
standing."</p>

<p>When any one is reading aloud, playing, or singing,
we ought to give him the same close attention
we would wish to receive if we were in his place.
Talking or moving about at such times is unpardonably
rude, and also looking at the clock as if we
were impatient for the performer to finish.</p>

<p>We should never interrupt with questions or remarks
a person engaged in reading or writing, and
to look over the shoulder of one so employed is impertinent.</p>

<p>If letters are brought to us, we should not open
and read them in company unless they require immediate
attention, when we should ask to be excused
for doing so.</p>

<p>We should give interested attention to books, pictures,
views, or games shown us for our entertainment,
and express pleasure and admiration when we
can with truth. If an article or a letter is given us
to read, we should not hand it back without remark,
or begin to read something else, as is often done by
people who ought to know better, but we should
thank the one who showed it to us, speak of it
politely, and if there is anything about it we can
commend, do so.</p>

<p>If we have occasion to make an inquiry of a
stranger, we should preface it with, "Excuse me,"
"Pardon me," or, "I beg your pardon," unless we
use the simpler form, "Will you please tell me,"
in beginning our question.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>It is ill-bred to contradict, especially if the one
addressed be an older person. If a person says in
our hearing that the lecture was given Thursday
evening, when it was really Wednesday, or that Miss
Green was at the concert with Miss White when we
know that Miss Gray was her companion, it is not
our place to embarrass the speaker by setting him
right. If we are appealed to, or if there is good
reason why we should correct the statement, we
should do so politely, with an apology for the
correction.</p>

<p>We ought to be willing in company to contribute
our share to the general entertainment. Unless we
are willing to give as well as receive, we had better
stay at home. It is ill-mannered to read aloud, sing,
or play to others unless we are invited to do so;
but if a request is made, it is much more polite and
agreeable to the company for us to comply cheerfully,
and do the best we can, than to wait for much urging
and then to burden the listeners with apologies before
we begin. If we do not feel able to do what is
asked of us, we should politely but positively decline
at first.</p>

<p>If games are proposed, unless there is some good
reason for our doing so, it is not polite to decline taking
part, saying, "I will see the rest play." If all did
this, nobody would be entertained. It is much more
the part of good manners to enter heartily into the
amusement of the hour, and do our best to make it
a success.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>It is this spirit of readiness to help on things that
makes useful members of society, and the more
earnestly boys and girls cultivate it the more fit they
will be for their duties as citizens. We ought not
to be content to be ciphers anywhere. As significant
figures, we shall be of more value in the world,
be happier ourselves, and make others happier.</p>

<h2>LESSON VIII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>MANNERS AT CHURCH.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> should try never to be late at church; it is a
disrespect to the place and the worship; it breaks
in upon the service, takes the attention of people
from it, and disturbs the minister. If we are late,
we must not go in during prayer time, but wait near
the door.</p>

<p>We should enter a church quietly and soberly.
Boys should be as particular as gentlemen to remove
their hats at the door, not half-way up the aisle, and
to open the pew door for ladies to pass in first. If
they are in the pew beforehand, they should rise and
pass out for ladies to enter.</p>

<p>When a seat is given us in a strange church, we
should not take it without acknowledgment. We
should welcome strangers to our pew, hand them a
book with the place found, and invite them to come
again. If we notice any one near us who cannot find
the hymn or place to read, we should quietly pass
him our open book.</p>

<p>It is worse to whisper or laugh in church than anywhere
else, for it is not only ill-bred but irreverent.
We should avoid moving about in our pews, looking
around at people, opening or shutting books, and
whatever disturbs the quiet of the place.</p>

<p>It is not in good taste to wear much jewelry at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
church, or showy articles of any kind that will attract
attention. A house of worship is no place for
striking effects in costume, such as might be proper
at a party or place of amusement.</p>

<p>We often see persons in church turn their heads
whenever the door is opened, to see who is coming
in. Such a disregard of good manners well deserved
the rebuke it received once from a Scotch minister,
who, annoyed by this habit, astonished his congregation
one Sunday morning by announcing to them the
name of each late comer as he entered.</p>

<p>If we cannot give respectful attention to the service,
we had better stay at home, and not disturb
those who go to church to worship.</p>

<p>The clergyman is often annoyed by the dropping
of hymn-books or prayer-books noisily into the rack,
especially at the close of the last hymn, when he is
waiting to pronounce the benediction. This might
be done as well and better without any noise whatever.</p>

<p>It is rude in the extreme to seize hats and rush for
the door as soon as the last word is said, or to engage
at once in idle chatter and laughter. There should
be a reverent pause, and then we should pass slowly
and quietly down the aisle. It is ill-bred to seem in
haste to be gone. Unless we can sit through the
service with patience, we should not attend it. Looking
at the clock or taking out one's watch during
service comes under the same condemnation as leaving
with unbecoming haste at the close.</p>

<h2>LESSON IX.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>MANNERS AT PLACES OF AMUSEMENT.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> we attend a lecture, concert, or other entertainment,
we should go in season: to enter after
the performance begins is a discourtesy to the performers
and an annoyance to every person in the
audience. If we are obliged to be late, we should
wait for a favorable time, and then be seated quickly
and quietly.</p>

<p>When there is a choice of seats we have a right to
take the best that remain when we arrive; but this
right offers no excuse for us to push and elbow other
people, or to obtain such seats by crowding others
aside. It is better to have the poorest seat in the
house or none at all than to sacrifice good manners
and self-respect. We often see disgraceful exhibitions
of selfishness at entertainments on the part of
people who pride themselves at home and in company
on their politeness.</p>

<p>If we are too early, or if there is delay in commencing,
we should wait with well-bred quietness.
Nothing marks more surely the ill-bred person than
noisy demonstrations of impatience at waiting. This
is one of the occasions to practise the graceful sitting
still which has been spoken of in the lesson on
manners in society.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>It is not polite to gaze at those around us, still less
to make remarks about them or their dress.</p>

<p>Loud talking and laughing, and all conduct calculated
to make ourselves conspicuous, should be
avoided. The people who attract attention in these
ways will be likely to eat candy, nuts, and popped
corn while the exercises are going on, and to violate
propriety in other ways.</p>

<p>Whispering during a performance is an offence
against good manners; yet it is surprising how common
the offence is. School children know how the
visitors on examination days often talk to each other
throughout the exercises, to the great disturbance of
the whole school as well as the teacher, and this recollection
ought to make them more careful to avoid
the impoliteness themselves. Many people seem to
attend places of amusement for the sole purpose of
talking with their friends. They will hold long discussions
upon dress, cooking, and family matters, as
if no music or speaking were in progress, and as
if no one else cared to hear more than they. If we
do not go to a concert to hear the music, we have no
right there; and the same is true at all public entertainments.</p>

<p>It is related of Margaret Fuller that at one of
Jenny Lind's concerts her evening's enjoyment was
destroyed by some rude young people who whispered
incessantly, laughed at each other's foolish jokes, and
paid no attention to the wonderful music. At the
close of the concert she sent for the young girl whose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
behavior had been most noticeable to come to her.
The girl was much flattered by the request from so
distinguished a person, though she was at a loss to
account for it. As she appeared with an air of
pleased curiosity, Margaret Fuller said to her, "I
hope that never again in your life will you be the
cause of so much annoyance and pain to any one as
you have been to me this evening."</p>

<p>It is to be hoped that this rebuke, with the good
advice given with it to this thoughtless girl, was a
lesson in good manners which she and her companions
never forgot.</p>

<p>To take out one's watch or to turn the head to
look at the clock is like saying we are impatient to
go, and must be disturbing to the speaker. If it is
necessary for us to look at a watch, we should do so
without its being seen, and should stifle in our pockets
the click of shutting it.</p>

<p>It is rude to applaud noisily: we can be enthusiastic
in applause without being boisterous.</p>

<p>Some ladies have a habit of carrying fancy work
to places of amusement. If they knit or crochet before
the performance begins, it is a foolish parade of
industry which is probably not carried out at home;
but if they continue the occupation after one begins
to sing or speak or read, it is impertinent, and extremely
annoying to the speaker. It seems like saying
that his words are not worthy of undivided attention,
but are of so little consequence that one can
take in their meaning and beauty while counting
stitches and studying patterns.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>We should be mindful of little courtesies to those
near us, such as handing our programme or opera-glass
to one who has none. If a question is asked
about the performance, we should answer with cordial
politeness and cheerfully give any information we
can.</p>

<p>We should never leave the hall while the performance
is going on. It is, like coming in late, an
affront to the performers and to the audience. Usually,
if we cannot stay until the close, we should stay
away. If there is any urgent reason, such as taking
a train, for our leaving before the close, we should
do so between the parts of a performance, and as
noiselessly as possible. When we stay to the end
we should remain seated and give our attention until
the last word is uttered. The speaker usually keeps
his best effort for the close, and he should not be
embarrassed, or those listening be disturbed, by the
confusion of preparations for departure. To reach
the door a minute or two sooner, or to get the best
seats in a car, is not worth the rudeness it requires.
We shall never be guilty of it if we only apply the
Golden Rule and consider how we should feel in the
speaker's place.</p>

<h2>LESSON X.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>MANNERS IN STORES AND SIMILAR PUBLIC PLACES.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">On</span> entering or leaving a store in cold weather we
should consider the comfort of those behind the
counters and shut the door, if there is no one whose
business it is to do it for us. We ought to state
clearly and definitely what we want to buy, and patiently
explain if the clerk, through inexperience or
dulness, does not at first understand our request.</p>

<p>A good supply of patience and politeness is needed
in shopping, and a true lady or gentleman will not
lose temper or forget good manners, even if a clerk
is impertinent or disobliging.</p>

<p>We should not make unnecessary trouble for clerks
by asking them to take down and unfold piece after
piece of goods for us to examine, if we have no intention
of buying. Many ladies do this habitually,
because they enjoy it, and then wonder that the clerks
are not more polite. If we wish merely to examine
before buying at some future time, it is better to say
so, and then the merchant or clerk will not be disappointed
if we do not purchase.</p>

<p>We should handle delicate fabrics in stores as carefully
as if they were our own, and not tumble them
over, leaving ribbons and laces in tangled heaps, especially
if we do not buy.</p>

<p>We should not find fault with the quality of articles.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
If we are not satisfied, it is enough to say that
the goods do not suit us, without making disparaging
remarks to the clerk, who has no responsibility in the
matter.</p>

<p>It is a sign of ignorance and ill-breeding to haggle
over the price of a thing and try to induce the seller
to take less for it. In Oriental countries, it is said,
the dealer always asks at first four times the price he
expects to receive, but in our country this is not customary,
and the price stated is supposed to be fair
and final. If we think the article is not worth the
price, or if it is beyond our means, it is best to say
we do not wish to pay so much and leave it. If the
dealer can afford to sell it cheaper, and will do so
for the sake of our buying, it is his place to offer
it for less, not ours to ask. If he asks more than a
thing is worth, hoping to take advantage of our need
of it or our ignorance, he ought to be punished by
our refusal to buy.</p>

<p>We should wait our turn at a counter and regard
the convenience of others as well as ourselves. It is
not polite to demand the attention of a clerk who is
waiting upon another customer, or to take up what
another is looking at. If we are in great haste, and
customers who seem to have plenty of time are at the
counter before us, we may sometimes ask their permission
to be waited on while they are looking at
goods, apologizing for doing so. If we are sitting
at a counter, we should politely give our seat to an
older lady, or to one who looks weary.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>If a clerk takes uncommon pains to please us, or
puts himself to more trouble than we have a right to
expect, we must not forget to thank him. If customers
are polite and considerate, they seldom have reason
to complain of those behind the counter. The
same is true at post-offices, railroad stations, and
wherever we are served by others.</p>

<p>These general principles of politeness in stores
can be applied in all similar public places.</p>

<p>The post-office is often the scene of most unmannerly
conduct on the part of boys and girls, especially
just after the close of school, when they all
rush in for letters. Instead of quietly walking up to
the window, one at a time, the boys giving way to the
girls when there is but one place of delivery, and
both boys and girls waiting for older people, they are
apt to go in by dozens, crowding to the window and
clamoring for their letters, making themselves extremely
annoying to all grown people present.</p>

<p>We should say, "I would like a dozen stamps, if
you please," or, "Please weigh this letter," rather
than, "I want a dozen stamps," or, "Weigh this
letter, will you?"</p>

<p>The post-office is a place of business, like a store
or a bank. Our only object in going there is to mail
or receive letters, which we should do like any other
business,&mdash;in a quiet, respectable manner. No one
has a right to stand around in the way of others, or to
make it a place of idle resort. No well-bred person,
even a child, will indulge in loud laughing and talking,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
staring at or making remarks about people, or
other conspicuous behavior here or in any public
resort.</p>

<p>A railroad station is also a place of business, and
unless it is necessary for us to go there, we had better
stay away. In small towns it is quite a fashion for
boys and girls to go to the station "to see the cars
come in"; but it is not improving to their manners or
morals. If they could realize, especially the girls,
how out of place they appear standing on platforms,
where they have no occasion to be, jostled by passengers
and baggage-men, and exposed to the rude
remarks of passers-by, they would never go there unnecessarily.</p>

<p>In all public places we should consider, in reference
to our conduct, two things: first, the courtesy
we owe to others; and second, the respect we owe to
ourselves.</p>

<h2>LESSON XI.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>MANNERS IN TRAVELLING.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Before</span> we fairly begin the journey we want to consider
what belongs to good manners at the station.</p>

<p>If the waiting-room is crowded, and there are not
seats for all, the young ought cheerfully to give place
to older people, especially to old ladies and to
mothers with little children in their arms. There is
often opportunity here to show little courtesies to
others which may brighten their whole day.</p>

<p>To amuse a fretful child for a few moments, or
bring it a glass of water when the mother cannot
leave other children to do it, or to find the baggage-master
and get a trunk checked for a nervous old
lady, is a small thing in itself, but it may be more
welcome to the receiver under the circumstances than
a far greater favor at another time. The comfort or
discomfort of a journey is made up of just such small
things.</p>

<p>When the ticket window is opened there is no
need for us to rush to it or to push aside any one
else. Time is given for all to buy their tickets comfortably.
We ought, if possible, to hand the exact
price of the ticket, and not take the ticket-seller's
time to change large bills. For the same reason we
should ask for the ticket in the briefest sentence we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
can frame, and if a question is necessary, put it in
the most business-like manner, and thank him for
the information given.</p>

<p>We should not attempt to get on the cars while
others are getting off: it hinders them and ourselves,
and nothing is gained by such unbecoming
haste. The much-ridiculed American hurry is well
illustrated by a company of people crowding up the
steps while another company is crowding down.
When we leave the cars it is better to wait until they
come to a full stop before rising from our seats. We
shall be likely to get out as soon as if we went swaying
down the aisle, crowding other people, and in
danger of falling headlong when the train finally
stops.</p>

<p>What has been said about obtaining seats at places
of amusement applies to seats in cars as well. Those
who come first have the first choice; but we should
not forget good manners in the choosing. We have
no right to more room than we pay for, and, unless
there are plenty of unoccupied seats, it is rude and
selfish to spread out our parcels and wraps so as to
discourage any one from asking to sit beside us;
yet a well-dressed woman, with her possessions unconcernedly
arranged on a seat facing her, ignoring
the fact that others are standing in the aisle, is not
an uncommon spectacle.</p>

<p>Courtesy in the cars or in a coach is as binding on
us as courtesy in the parlor, and never, perhaps, is
it better appreciated than by tired travellers.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>Good-breeding does not require a gentleman or a
boy to offer his seat to any lady who is standing, but
he should never fail to do it to an old lady or one
with a child in her arms, or one with an inconvenient
package; and it is pleasant to see that fine
politeness which prompts its possessor to treat every
lady as he would wish his mother or sister treated.
A lady should not accept such a civility in silence.
We too often see her drop into a seat which a gentleman
rises to offer as if it were her right, without a
word or even a bow of acknowledgment. Such a
person has no right to expect a similar courtesy the
second time.</p>

<p>If any one leaves his seat for a time without leaving
any piece of property in it to show that it belongs
to him, he cannot lawfully claim it on returning;
but civility should prevent any one from taking it, if
he knows it belongs to another.</p>

<p>In travelling, as everywhere in public, noisy conversation
and the "loud laugh that speaks the vacant
mind" are offensive to good taste. Constant eating
of fruit and peanuts is bad manners, and, as has been
said before, it is generally associated with loud talking
and laughing and other rude behavior.</p>

<p>On long journeys it is necessary to eat luncheons
or even regular meals, but this, done in a well-bred
way, is a very different thing from the continual
eating indulged in by a certain class of travellers.</p>

<p>We should not sit down beside another without
asking if the seat is engaged. If a person asks to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
sit beside us, we should assent with cordiality, not
sullenly gather up our bundles, as we often see people
do, impatient at having their selfish ease disturbed.
It is polite for a gentleman to offer a lady the seat
next the window.</p>

<p>We ought to have our ticket ready when the conductor
comes around, and not keep him waiting while
we hunt for it in bag or pocket.</p>

<p>If a brakeman raises a window or shuts a door for
us, we should thank him; and it is polite to thank the
train boy who passes us water. We need not be
ill-natured because he puts a magazine or prize
package in our lap every half-hour. It is not an
uncivil thing to do, and it is just as easy for us to
receive it civilly, and say in a pleasant tone that we
do not care for it, as to add one more snappish
answer to the many given him in the course of a
day.</p>

<p>We should be watchful of occasions to show politeness
to our fellow-travellers. There may be an
old lady not accustomed to travelling, anxious and
uneasy, to whom we can be of use. We can ask
where she is going, and take the burden off her mind
by saying, "I will tell you when we come to it."</p>

<p>A gentlemanly boy will not see a lady trying to
open or shut a window or reverse a seat without
offering to do it for her, any more than a gentleman
would.</p>

<p>We should be patient in answering questions,
especially from old people. If we are passing objects<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
of interest with which we are familiar, it is polite to
speak of them to a stranger sitting near. If we were
journeying in the White Mountain region and were
well acquainted with it, a stranger by our side would
like to know the names of the different peaks, and
to have the historic Willey House pointed out to
him. One cheerful, obliging person will add to the
comfort of the whole company.</p>

<p>If delays occur on the way, and long periods of
waiting, as often happen, we should be patient and
cheerful over the matter ourselves, and thus help
others to be so. Good-nature is contagious at such
times. It is of no use to tire the conductor and
brakemen with repeated questions: they are rarely
responsible for the delay, which is more vexatious to
them than to us.</p>

<p>Places for refreshment on a journey, with the brief
time usually allowed, afford opportunities to show
one's good or ill breeding. It would be better to
have no lunch than to struggle for the best place
and loudly demand attention, to the exclusion of
others. To bring a cup of tea to an old lady, or to
the mother who cannot leave her baby to get it herself,
is a slight thing for us to do, but it may be a
great favor to them.</p>

<p>In an article on the politeness of French children
as compared with boys and girls in America, the
writer illustrates what he is saying in this way:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I was travelling in a compartment with a little
French boy of twelve, the age at which American<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
children, as a rule, deserve killing for their rudeness
and general disagreeableness. I sat between him
and the open window, and he was eating pears. Now
most boys in our country of that age would either
have dropped the cores upon the floor or tossed them
out of the window, without regard to anybody. But
this small gentleman, every time, with a 'Permit me,
sir,' said in the most pleasant way, rose and came to
the window and dropped them out, and then with a
'Thanks, sir,' quietly took his seat. French children
do not take favors as a matter of course and unacknowledged.
And when in his seat, if an elderly
person came in, he was the very first to rise and
offer his place, if it were in the slightest degree more
comfortable than another; and the good-nature with
which he insisted on the new-comer's taking it was
delightful to see."</p>

<p>The writer goes on to say that this was not an exceptional
boy, but a fair type of the average French
child, and his conduct was a sample of what might
be seen anywhere, even among the ragged boys of
the street. The reason for this state of things is
given in the opening sentences of the article:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Politeness, with the French, is a matter of education
as well as nature. The French child is taught
that lesson from the beginning of its existence, and
it is made a part of its life. It is the one thing that
is never forgotten, and the lack of it never forgiven."</p>

<h2>LESSON XII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>MANNERS IN BORROWING.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is an old saying, "He that goes borrowing goes
sorrowing"; but it might often be more truly said of
the one to whom the borrower goes.</p>

<p>We should be more careful of a borrowed article
than if it were our own. If we are so unfortunate
as to injure or lose it, we should replace it, if it can
be done; if not, make the best possible apology.
We have no right to lend a borrowed thing to an
other without the owner's permission. Perhaps nothing
is treated in this way oftener than a book. People
who consider themselves honest and just will
lend a borrowed book to half a neighborhood, and if
it is defaced or lost will give themselves no concern
about it.</p>

<p>It is not polite to borrow a garment to wear except
of a relative or intimate friend. Neither is it good
manners to ask for a garment or pattern to cut one
by for ourselves: the owner may prefer not to have
it copied. If a person admires a garment or pattern
belonging to us, and we are willing to lend it, it is
our place to offer it without its being asked for.</p>

<p>If a book or article to read is lent us, we should
read it promptly, and when we return it say whatever
pleasant things we can of it with truth. To send it
back without expressing an opinion, or making <a name="acknowledgment" id="acknowledgment"></a>acknowledgment
of the kindness, is inexcusable.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>If we borrow something which is not to be returned
itself, but its equivalent, we should be careful
to return what is of as good or better quality, and
as much in quantity, if not a little more, to make up
for the trouble of the one who lends to us.</p>

<p>It is not polite to keep a borrowed article long;
and if a time for returning it is specified, we should
be careful not to neglect doing it when the time
comes. If possible, we should return it ourselves,
not give it to the owner to carry home or send it by
another; and we should never omit to thank the
lender. To compel the owner to send for his property
is a gross violation of good manners on the part
of the borrower. The owner should not send unless
he feels that he can wait no longer, or unless the
borrower is habitually careless and needs to be taught
a lesson.</p>

<p>"I never ask a gentleman to return money he has
borrowed," said one man to another.</p>

<p>"How then do you get it?" asked his friend.</p>

<p>"After a while," was the answer, "I conclude he
is not a gentleman, and then I ask him."</p>

<p>This reasoning will apply in case of lending other
things as well as money.</p>

<p>When we lend we should do so with cordial politeness
and not spoil the favor by the half-hearted way
in which we offer or grant it; but borrowing should
be regarded as a necessary evil, to be resorted to only
when it cannot well be avoided. The habitual borrower
is a burden to society.</p>

<div class='center'><br /><b>SEVEN DAUGHTERS.</b><br />

By Miss <span class="smcap">A. M. Douglas</span>, Author of "In Trust," "Stephen Dane," "Claudia,"<br />
"Sydnie Adriance," "Home Nook," "Nelly Kennard's Kingdom."<br />
12mo, cloth, illustrated. $1.50.<br /></div>

<p>"A charming romance of Girlhood," full of incident and humor. The "Seven
Daughters" are characters which reappear in some of Miss Douglas' later books. In
this book they form a delightful group, hovering on the verge of Womanhood, with
all the little perplexities of home life and love dreams as incidentals, making a fresh and
attractive story.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>OUR HELEN.</b><br />

By <span class="smcap">Sophie May</span>. 12mo, cloth, illustrated. $1.50.<br /></div>

<p>"The story is a very attractive one, as free from the sensational and impossible as
could be desired, and at the same time full of interest, and pervaded by the same bright,
cheery sunshine that we find in the author's earlier books. She is to be congratulated
on the success of her essay in a new field of literature, to which she will be warmly welcomed
by those who know and admire her 'Prudy Books.'"&mdash;<i>Graphic.</i></p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>THE ASBURY TWINS.</b><br />

By <span class="smcap">Sophie May</span>, Author of "The Doctor's Daughter," "Our Helen," &amp;c. 12mo,<br />
cloth, illustrated. $1.50.<br /></div>

<p>"Has the ring of genuine genius, and the sparkle of a gem of the first water. We
read it one cloudy winter day, and it was as good as a Turkish bath, or a three hours'
soak in the sunshine."&mdash;<i>Cooperstown Republican.</i></p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>THAT QUEER GIRL.</b><br />


By Miss <span class="smcap">Virginia F. Townsend</span>, Author of "Only Girls," &amp;c. 12mo, cloth, illustrated.<br />
$1.50.<br />
</div>

<p>Queer only in being unconventional, brave and frank, an "old-fashioned girl," and
very sweet and charming. As indicated in the title, is a little out of the common track,
and the wooing and the winning are as queer as the heroine. The <i>New Haven
Register</i> says: "Decidedly the best work which has appeared from the pen of Miss
Townsend."</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>RUNNING TO WASTE.</b><br />


<b>The Story of a Tomboy.</b> By <span class="smcap">George M. Baker</span>. 16mo, cloth, illustrated.<br />
$1.50.<br />
</div>

<p>"This book is one of the most entertaining we have read for a long time. It is well
written, full of humor, and good humor, and it has not a dull or uninteresting page.
It is lively and natural, and overflowing with the best New England character and
traits. There is also a touch of pathos, which always accompanies humor, in the life
and death of the tomboy's mother."&mdash;<i>Newburyport Herald.</i></p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>DAISY TRAVERS:</b><br />


<b>Or the Girls of Hive Hall.</b> By <span class="smcap">Adelaide F. Samuels</span>, Author of "Dick and<br />
Daisy Stories," "Dick Travers Abroad," &amp;c. 16mo, cloth, illustrated. $1.50.<br />
</div>

<p>The story of Hive Hall is full of life and action, and told in the same happy
style which made the earlier life of its heroine so attractive, and caused the Dick and
Daisy books to become great favorites with the young. What was said of the younger
books can, with equal truth, be said of Daisy grown up.</p>

we fail to discover it. It is a compendium of the world's eloquence. It is

<p>Pupils in public schools, on declamation days, are limited to five minutes
each for the delivery of "pieces." There is a great complaint of the scarcity
of material for such a purpose, while the injudicious pruning of eloquent
extracts has often marred the desired effects. To obviate these difficulties
new "Five-Minute" books have been prepared by a competent teacher.</p>

<h3><b>Arranged for Young People by M. S. EMERY</b></h3>

<div class='center'>Price, boards, 30 cents net.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By mail, 35 cents.</div>

<div class='cap'>AN accurate knowledge of how to attend to the every-day affairs of a
business life is, indeed, a most valuable possession. The requirements
of modern business life are manifold and exacting, demanding
technical information, and, besides, quite a degree of what may
justly be termed "cultivation." This valuable and indispensable
book covers a wide range of information of much importance, and is
designed as a text-book for schools, and for ready reference for young
people and those who need such instruction as it contains. It treats in
an attractive and clear manner subjects which bear on every-day callings,
like "Letter-writing," by which so large a percentage of business is conducted;
"Bills, Receipts, and Accounts;" "Post-Office Business," with
instructions regarding late advantages and scope of accommodation;
"Telegrams," "Express Business," "United States Money," "Savings
Banks," "National Banks," "Bank Checks," "Notes and Drafts,"
"Mortgages," "Investment and Speculation," "Taxes," "Fire Insurance,"
and "Life Insurance." These are topics conveying a general
idea of the worth of the book&mdash;topics about which business men must
know, and covering that which they who would be business men must
learn. Keeping relatively abreast of modern methods, the educators of
our day see the necessity of imparting <i>business knowledge</i>, as well as that
which is purely scientific, historical, or literary in its nature; hence, the
adaptability of "Every-Day Business" to the necessities of American
schools and our progressive ways of life.</div>

<p>"After making child-nature a special study, Miss Sparhawk offers this
little book as its result. It is designed to be used as a supplementary
reader for classes in geography, and in cases of very young children as
preparatory to the definitions and statements of text-books, which to children
so often mean nothing. Still, the author does not intend that because
this book is used all verbal explanations should be done away with; and
while it is designed to take the place of aimless and weary work, it is not
at all intended to do away with work and substitute play in its stead. The
subjects treated preclude that idea. Such topics as the following require
study and work on the part of both teacher and pupil: 'The Horizon,'
'Trees,' 'Vegetation,' 'Heat and Moisture,' 'Water-sheds,' 'Sun and
Rain,' 'Highways and Barriers,' 'From the Lakes to the Gulf,'
'Cities,' 'Mountains and Rivers,' and many more important topics, including
the continents."&mdash;<i>School Journal.</i></p>

<div class='cap'>THIS, in very truth, is a "rare gem of a book" of its character. In

and home pleasure, with pieces for birthday and wedding
anniversaries, Decoration Day, and other occasional celebrations. The
foundation purpose of the book is grand,&mdash;the many varieties of composition,
which include almost numberless methods of expressing beautiful
and valuable thoughts and sentiments; the remarkable adaptability of the
pieces to elevate the mind, attract the quick and abiding interest of the
reader; the noble spirit; the persuasive and gentle rhythm; rich, yet
plain language,&mdash;render this little volume one of substantial merit and
permanent worth; and as the simple expression of great thoughts appeals
to young and old alike, so "Speaking Pieces" will find admirers other
than "little scholars and older pupils."</div>
